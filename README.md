## Description

### Failed project

This was an attempt to follow the Next JS tutorial 

https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app/setting-up-your-database


Could not get past 48 sec of deployment, looking for a missing string.  Intructions on tutorial lack any information about editing .env file properly for this deployment.

Followed stack and other suggestions to no avail.  pnpm i vercel's cli and no good. crashing project. starting anew in another repo

Will integrate Vercel CLI at initiation phase of app





### Run instructions for basic build from Next JS

  pnpm run dev
    Starts the development server.

  pnpm run build
    Builds the app for production.

  pnpm start
    Runs the built app in production mode.

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd nextjs-dashboard
  pnpm run dev
